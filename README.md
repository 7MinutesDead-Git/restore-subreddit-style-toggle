# restore-subreddit-style-toggle
Chrome extension for restoring RES-provided subreddit-style toggle, that certain subreddits deliberately hide to prevent you from getting around their styles/restrictions.

# To quickly use this:
1) Clone this repo.
2) Open "Manage Extensions" in Chrome.
3) In the top-right corner, toggle on Developer Mode.
4) Click "Load Unpacked", then navigate to your repo's directory and select the root folder.

Enjoy!

# Notes
Sometimes it takes a moment for a reddit page to finish completely loading, which is when this background script is ran, so hidden subreddit style toggles may take a few seconds to pop up.  
You can check the Console within Chrome to see the status. Look for logged messages with üê† fishies üê†!
  
# Why not just automatically toggle the style off?  
  
The intent of this script/extension is to give you *back* the option to toggle it off, though there may be some subreddit styles you enjoy that *also* hide the option to turn off their style.  
  
# It's not working!  
  
Create a github issue here with the name of the subreddit it isn't working on so I can check it out and see if a different method for restoration is needed.
  
Double check to make sure the extension has successfully loaded with no errors in the "Manage Extensions" menu.
