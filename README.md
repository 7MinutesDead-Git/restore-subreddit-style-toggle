# restore-subreddit-style-toggle
Chrome extension for restoring RES-provided subreddit-style toggle, that certain subreddits deliberately hide to prevent you from getting around their styles/restrictions.

# To quickly use this:
1) Clone this repo.
2) Open "Manage Extensions" in Chrome.
3) In the top-right corner, toggle on Developer Mode.
4) Click "Load Unpacked", then navigate to your repo's directory and select the root folder.

Enjoy!

# Notes
Sometimes it takes a moment for the page to finish completely loading, so hidden subreddit style toggles may take a few seconds to pop up.  
You can check the Console within Chrome to see the status. Look for logged messages with 🐠 fishies 🐠!
